# Wordle Remake
This is just another Wordle remake using JavaScript, HTML, and a bit of jQuery for AJAX requests. The game behaves in the a similar way to the original Wordle hosted at: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html. Every day, the word changes are handled by a PHP script which only requests a new word when a new day has passed.
